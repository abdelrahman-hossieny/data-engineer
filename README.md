### Project One: CSV Data Analysis Project

This project involves analyzing CSV data using Python libraries such as pandas and matplotlib. Below are the main steps and highlights of the project:

#### 1. Reading Data
- The data was read from a CSV file using the pandas library.

#### 2. Data Cleaning
- Rows with missing data were removed to ensure data quality.
- A specific column was converted to the `datetime` data type for accurate time-based analysis.

#### 3. Calculations
- Performed additional calculations such as the product of `S-P3` and `S-P4`.
- Added a new column to the DataFrame to store the calculated values.
  
#### 4. Data Analysis
- **Monthly Sales**: Calculated the total sales for each month.
- **Product Quantity**: Collected the total quantity sold for each product type.
- **Product Sales**: Summarized the total sales for each product type.

#### 5. Data Visualization
- Data visualizations were created using the matplotlib library to provide insights into sales trends and product performance.
